 Todays Plan:

Get the invoke.js working i.e. insert a new block on the blockchain

Method to achieve this:

1)change the method to the query block to see if its going inside the insertBLock function
2) If it is thats great that means there is something wrong inside the functin.

Sucess: I forgot to include the "return" in the invoke go function

Bonus Points:

1) Need to take a look at admin and regiter user

 2) Each user we generate we need to create a channel for them, which means we need to create a channel between two or more peers and install the chaincode on those peers. 

3) Allow a peer to join a channel: which involves creating a new member(organisation) and then create a peer for that member and install the chaincode onto the peer (if required).
