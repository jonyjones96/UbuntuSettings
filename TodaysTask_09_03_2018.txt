To Do:

1) Add a peer to the .yml to see if i can do it correctly, in a worst case senario when we want add an organisation we will edit the file bring the network down and restarting it.

2) Try to create a new channel - needed to generate a new user.


Bonus Points:

1) Add an orgnistion without bringing the network down.
